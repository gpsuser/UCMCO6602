# Lecture: Cryptography and Ciphers

## Introduction
Welcome to our two-hour session on cryptography and ciphers. Today, we'll delve into the core principles and methods that form the bedrock of modern cryptography. We'll cover foundational theories introduced by Claude Shannon, explore both symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and compare block ciphers to stream ciphers. We'll also examine key standards such as DES and AES, their applications, and the evolving landscape of cryptographic security.

## Claude Shannon's Contributions to Cryptography
Claude Shannon, known as the father of modern cryptography, introduced seminal concepts that have shaped the field.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Confusion and Diffusion:** These are the principles Shannon proposed for designing secure ciphers. 
    - **Confusion:** Makes the relationship between the ciphertext and the encryption key as complex as possible.
    - **Diffusion:** Spreads the plaintext information across the ciphertext to hide statistical properties.
  - **Characteristics of Good Ciphers:**
    - **Avalanche Effect:** A small change in plaintext results in a significant change in ciphertext.
    - **Statistical Independence:** Ciphertext should be statistically independent of the plaintext.

## Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption
- **Symmetric Encryption:**
  - Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
  - Examples: DES, AES
  - **Advantages:**
    - Faster and more efficient for large data.
    - Easier to implement.
  - **Drawbacks:**
    - Key distribution and management can be problematic.
  
- **Asymmetric Encryption:**
  - Uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
  - Examples: RSA, ECC
  - **Advantages:**
    - Enhanced security for key distribution.
    - Suitable for digital signatures.
  - **Drawbacks:**
    - Slower than symmetric encryption.
    - Computationally intensive.

## Block Ciphers vs. Stream Ciphers
- **Block Ciphers:**
  - Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 128 bits).
  - Examples: AES, DES
  - **Advantages:**
    - Suitable for encrypting large volumes of data.
    - Strong security properties.
  - **Drawbacks:**
    - Can be less efficient for smaller data.
  
- **Stream Ciphers:**
  - Encrypts data one bit or byte at a time.
  - Examples: RC4, Salsa20
  - **Advantages:**
    - Fast and efficient for continuous streams of data.
    - Less memory requirement.
  - **Drawbacks:**
    - Potential vulnerabilities if the key stream is not properly managed.

## Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- **Overview:**
  - Developed in the 1970s, DES was a widely adopted symmetric-key algorithm.
  - Uses 56-bit keys and encrypts data in 64-bit blocks.
  
- **Algorithm Explanation:**
  - **Initial Permutation (IP):** Shuffles the bits of the plaintext.
  - **Feistel Structure:** Comprises 16 rounds of processing involving:
    - **Expansion:** Expands the 32-bit half-block to 48 bits.
    - **Key Mixing:** XOR operation with a subkey.
    - **Substitution:** Uses S-boxes to substitute bits.
    - **Permutation:** Rearranges bits to add diffusion.

## Concept of Chaining
- **Motivation:**
  - Enhances the security of block ciphers by ensuring that identical plaintext blocks yield different ciphertext blocks.
  
- **Methods:**
  - **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):** Uses an Initialization Vector (IV) and XORs each block with the previous ciphertext block before encryption.
  - **Counter (CTR) Mode:** Turns block ciphers into stream ciphers by combining block encryption with a counter.

## Triple DES
- **Overview:**
  - Enhances security by applying DES encryption three times with different keys (K1, K2, K3).
  
- **Advantages:**
  - Increases the key length effectively to 168 bits.
  - Provides stronger security than DES.
  
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Slower than single DES.
  - More computationally intensive.

## Advanced Encryption System (AES)
- **Overview:**
  - Successor to DES, AES uses key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
  - Encrypts data in 128-bit blocks.
  
- **Algorithm Explanation:**
  - **SubBytes:** Substitutes bytes using an S-box.
  - **ShiftRows:** Shifts rows of the state array.
  - **MixColumns:** Mixes the columns of the state array.
  - **AddRoundKey:** XORs the state array with the round key.

## DES vs. AES
| Feature | DES | AES |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Key Length | 56 bits | 128, 192, 256 bits |
| Block Size | 64 bits | 128 bits |
| Security | Vulnerable to brute-force attacks | Highly secure |
| Speed | Slower | Faster |

## Attacking Symmetric Encryption
- **Exhaustive Key Search:**
  - **Definition:** A brute-force attack that tries all possible keys until the correct one is found.
  - **Time Required:**
    - For DES (56-bit key): Approximately \(2^{56}\) attempts, which is feasible with modern computing power.
    - For AES (128-bit key): Approximately \(2^{128}\) attempts, making it infeasible with current technology.
