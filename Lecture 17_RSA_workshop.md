CO6602 Workshop RSA/Public-Key Exercises

Exercise 1: 

Let 𝑝=11 and 𝑞=5 be given as set-up parameters for RSA. 
a) Given that e = 7, compute the corresponding private key 𝑑 
b) What other values can be used for e?

Exercise 2: 

Let 𝑝=41 and 𝑞=17 be given as set-up parameters for RSA. 
a) Which of the parameters 𝑒1=32,𝑒2=49 is a valid RSA exponent? Justify your choice. 
b) Compute the corresponding private key 𝑑

Exercise 3: 

Encrypt and decrypt by means of the RSA algorithm with the following system parameters: 
a) 𝑝=5,𝑞=11,𝑒=3,𝑋=9 
b) 𝑝=3,𝑞=11,𝑑=7,𝑋=5
c)

Exercise 4: 

List the square-and-multiply steps for calculating 𝑥29 and give the value for 𝑥 = 2.

Exercise 5: 

Bob wants to receive a message from Alice and has chosen 𝑝 = 7 and 𝑞 = 17. Calculate Bob’s key pair and use his public key to encrypt the plaintext 𝑋 = 4. Decrypt the generated ciphertext as well.
Hint: 𝑑=77

Exercise 6: 

Bob has encrypted his message to Alice with his private key. How does Alice know it is from Bob and why is she upset?
