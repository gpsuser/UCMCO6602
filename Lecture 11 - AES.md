# Lecture 11 - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

## Introduction

Today's lecture is on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). As one of the most widely deployed symmetric encryption algorithms in the world, AES forms the backbone of modern secure communications. Throughout this session, we'll explore its history, internal workings, practical applications, and security implications.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

- Explain the historical context and development of AES
- Understand the mathematical foundations and structural components of AES
- Analyze the security properties of AES
- Implement a basic version of AES using Python
- Evaluate the strengths and potential vulnerabilities of AES

### 1. Historical Context and Development

#### 1.1 The Need for a New Standard

The Data Encryption Standard (DES), established in 1977, served as the federal standard for symmetric encryption in the United States for over two decades. However, by the late 1990s, several factors necessitated its replacement:

- DES's 56-bit key length became vulnerable to brute-force attacks
- The rise of distributed computing made such attacks increasingly feasible
- Triple DES, while more secure, was computationally intensive

#### 1.2 The AES Competition

In 1997, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) initiated a competition to develop a successor to DES. The requirements included:

- Symmetric block cipher design
- Support for 128, 192, and 256-bit key lengths
- Royalty-free worldwide use
- Public scrutiny and evaluation

From fifteen submissions, five finalists emerged:
- Rijndael (eventual winner)
- Serpent
- Twofish
- RC6
- MARS

#### 1.3 Rijndael's Selection

Rijndael, designed by Belgian cryptographers Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen, was selected as the winner in 2000 and standardized as AES in 2001. Key factors in its selection included:

- Excellent security margins
- Efficient implementation in both hardware and software
- Clean mathematical structure
- Flexibility across different platforms

### 2. Technical Deep Dive: AES Structure and Operation

#### 2.1 General Structure

AES operates on a 4×4 matrix of bytes, called the State. Key characteristics include:

- Block size: 128 bits (16 bytes)
- Key sizes: 128, 192, or 256 bits
- Number of rounds:
  - 10 rounds for 128-bit keys
  - 12 rounds for 192-bit keys
  - 14 rounds for 256-bit keys

#### 2.2 Core Operations

AES employs four main transformations in each round:

1. **SubBytes**: Non-linear byte substitution using an S-box
   - Provides confusion
   - Ensures non-linearity
   - Resistant to differential and linear cryptanalysis

2. **ShiftRows**: Cyclic shifting of rows
   - Provides diffusion
   - Ensures each column in the output depends on every column in the input

3. **MixColumns**: Column mixing using matrix multiplication
   - Provides additional diffusion
   - Ensures each byte affects four bytes in the next round

4. **AddRoundKey**: XOR with round key
   - Combines the state with the round key
   - Provides the core encryption mechanism

### 3. Mathematics Behind AES

#### 3.1 Finite Field Operations

AES operates in the Galois Field GF(2⁸), which provides several advantages:

- All operations result in 8-bit values
- Addition is performed as XOR
- Multiplication uses modular arithmetic

#### 3.2 The S-Box Construction

The SubBytes transformation uses a substitution box (S-box) constructed through:

1. Multiplicative inverse in GF(2⁸)
2. Affine transformation over GF(2)

This construction ensures:

- Non-linearity
- Resistance to algebraic attacks
- Minimal correlation between input and output bits

### 4. Security Analysis

#### 4.1 Security Strengths

1. **Mathematical Foundation**
   - Based on well-understood mathematical principles
   - Thoroughly analyzed by the cryptographic community

2. **Resistance to Known Attacks**
   - No practical attacks against full-round AES
   - Strong resistance to differential and linear cryptanalysis

3. **Key Size Options**
   - 128-bit: 2¹²⁸ possible keys
   - 256-bit: 2²⁵⁶ possible keys (quantum resistant)

#### 4.2 Potential Vulnerabilities

1. **Implementation Attacks**
   - Side-channel attacks possible on poor implementations
   - Cache timing attacks in software implementations
   - Power analysis attacks in hardware implementations

2. **Key Management**
   - Secure key distribution remains challenging
   - Key storage must be properly secured

### 5. Practical Implementation

        """
        return [[state[i][j] ^ round_key[i][j] 
                for j in range(4)] for i in range(4)]

    def encrypt_block(self, plaintext: List[List[int]], 
                     key: List[List[int]], rounds: int = 10) -> List[List[int]]:

        """
        state = plaintext
        
        # Initial round
        state = self.add_round_key(state, key)
        
        # Main rounds
        for _ in range(rounds - 1):
            state = self.sub_bytes(state)
            state = self.shift_rows(state)
            state = self.mix_columns(state)
            state = self.add_round_key(state, key)  # Simplified key schedule
        
        # Final round (no MixColumns)
        state = self.sub_bytes(state)
        state = self.shift_rows(state)
        state = self.add_round_key(state, key)
        
        return state
